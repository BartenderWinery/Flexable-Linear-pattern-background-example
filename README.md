# Flexable-Linear-pattern-background-example
 An example of a looping function to create a background with linear gradients and patterns

# Explanation
    Automating element creation: This example shows how looping works and how to can help you with multiple elements.
    Here, "for (let step = 0; step < 120; step++) { Code here}", we loop the code inside 120 times. This is how we can easily automate code.
    We are able to formate the panels created from the code by using a flex container. Therefore, creating a pattern.

    Linear gradients: The linear gradient seen on the example behind the panels is created and controled by, "background: linear-gradient(225deg,#333333,#141414); background-size: 400% 400%;"

    Multiple animation keyframes are used in the css file to create a moving linear gradient. 

# Requirements
    `Jquery; https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js`
    `Javascript;`
    `CSS;`

# Common mistakes
    A common mistake a new user of javascript can make is declaring a javascript before a div is created. If a javascript handles or create an element, it should be linked at the end of the html file, before all elements to prevent any errors.

All scripts are hosted inside the html file
